            <h1>Bar Candy</h1>
            <p>
                BAR CANDY® creator Liz Green was a bartender in Los Angeles and started experimenting with flavors
                behind the bar. Before too long she was winning cocktail competitions and liquor companies were hiring
                her to create cocktails for their brands.
                She then created menus for restaurants, bars and nightclubs, and authored an original cocktail book
                called Cocktail Hollywood.
            </p>
            <p>
                She ran a series of nightclubs in New York, and after realizing that the cocktail craze wasn’t going
                anywhere, she decided to create an experience. It was at this time that Bar Candy® was born!

                FUN FACT: BAR CANDY® made it to the final round of Shark Tank beating out thousands of people. It came
                down to BAR CANDY® and another brand!
